BORG – Search and save shell snippets without leaving your terminal

Borg was built out of the frustration of having to leave the terminal to search and click around for bash snippets.
Glance over multiple snippets quickly with Borg's succinct output.

### Search

```
borg "list only files"
```

```shell
(1) Bash: How to list only files?
        [a] find . -maxdepth 1 -type f
        [b] ls -l | egrep -v '^d'
            ls -l | grep -v '^d'

(2) List only common parent directories for files
        [a] # read a line into the variable "prefix", split at slashes
            IFS=/ read -a prefix
            # while there are more lines, one after another read them into "next",
            # also split at slashes
            while IFS=/ read -a next; do
                new_prefix=()
                # for all indexes in prefix
                for ((i=0; i < "${#prefix[@]}"; ++i)); do
                    # if the word in the new line matches the old one
                    if [[ "${prefix[i]}" == "${next[i]}" ]]; then
        ...
```

Use `borg pipeto less` to pipe the results straight to `less` (or another program).

### Install

The following releases only let you search snippets. To add or edit snippets, install from source. Releases are coming soon.

```
brew install borg
```

For Linux, download [a release](https://github.com/sniperkit/borg/releases) manually:

```
wget https://github.com/sniperkit/borg/releases/download/v0.0.3/borg_linux_amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/borg
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/borg
```

Same for Mac:

```
wget https://github.com/sniperkit/borg/releases/download/v0.0.3/borg_darwin_amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/borg
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/borg
```

### Rate results: `worked`

When a result works for you, use the `worked` command to give feedback:

```
borg worked 12
```

This will rank the result higher for similar queries—especially helpful when a good result was buried in the search results.

### Advanced usage

For more commands and their explanations, please see [advanced usage](https://github.com/sniperkit/borg/tree/master/docs).

### How does borg work?

The client connects to a server at [ok-b.org](https://ok-b.org/). You can host your own server too (see daemon folder), though self-hosting will become less appealing once people start contributing their own content to the database.

### UI explanation

- `()` denotes hits for your query
- `[]` denotes snippets found for a given query
- `...` under a `[]` means more lines to display (use the `-f` flag for full display, see more about usage below)

### Credits

The borg mascot has been delivered to you by the amazing [Fabricio Rosa Marques](https://dribbble.com/fabric8).

### Community

- Use the [dockerized borg client](https://github.com/juhofriman/borg-docker) if you don't want to install anything on your host!

### Outages

- We've had a multi day outage Jan 18–28. It ruined our uptime stats for the next thousand years.
